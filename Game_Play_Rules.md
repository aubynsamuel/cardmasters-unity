# **Game Rules**

## **Setup**

- **Cards Used**: 6 through 10, Jack, Queen, and King of each suit (diamonds, spades, hearts, clubs).
- **Deal**:
  1. Shuffle the deck.
  2. Deal 3 cards to each player clockwise, starting with the player to the right of the dealer.
  3. Then deal 2 more cards to each player in the same direction (total of 5 cards per player).
  4. Players cannot see each other’s cards.

## **Gameplay**

1. **First Turn**: The player who received the first card begins.
2. **Control**: The player in control plays any card from their hand.
3. **Following Turns**: Moving clockwise, each player must:
   - Play a card of the same suit if they have one.
   - Play any card if they don’t have the called suit.
4. **Gaining Control**:
   - If a player plays a card of the called suit that is higher than any previous card of that suit in the trick, they gain control.
5. **Winning the Round**:
   - After all 5 cards have been played, the player in control is the winner of the round.

## **Important Rules**

- Players must play a card of the called suit if they have one (no holding back).
- If a player is caught hiding a card of the called suit, they are disqualified.
- Strategy involves saving higher cards for later tricks when possible.
- **No duplicate cards**: Since only one deck is used, each card is unique, ensuring no ties in control.

## **Scoring System**

### **Basic Point Values**

- Playing a **6** and maintaining control: **3 points**.
- Playing a **7** and maintaining control: **2 points**.
- Playing any other card (**8-K**) and maintaining control: **1 point**.

### **Special Accumulation Rule**

- Points only accumulate when playing **6s and 7s** while maintaining control.
- Playing **8-K resets the accumulation** (they are always worth just **1 point**).
- **Control Reset**: If a player **loses control**, their accumulated points **reset to 0**.
- Only the **final controlling player** (winner of the round) adds their accumulated points to their game score.

### **Same Suit Rule**

- When a player plays **cards of the same suit** in succession while maintaining control, **only the most recently played card's value counts**.
  - Example: Playing **6♠ → 7♠** = **2 points** (only the 7 counts).
  - Example: Playing **7♣ → 6♣** = **3 points** (only the 6 counts).

### **Different Suit Rule**

- When a player plays **6s and 7s of different suits** in succession while maintaining control, the points **accumulate**.
  - Example: **6♦ → 7♠** = **5 points** (3 + 2).
  - Example: **6♥ → 7♠ → 7♥** = **7 points** (3 + 2 + 2).
  - Example: **7♦ → 6♦ → 6♣** = **6 points** (3 + 3, since the first 6♦ is ignored).

### **Control Transfer Rule**

- If a player **loses control** by playing a **6** or **7** and another player overtakes them with a **higher card of the same suit**, the new controlling player **only earns 1 point** instead of the usual value.
  - Example: Player A plays **6♦**, Player B plays **7♦** → Player B only gets **1 point**.
  - Example: Player A plays **7♠**, Player B plays **6♠** → Player B only gets **1 point**.

### **Maximum Potential**

- With the right combination of **6s and 7s of different suits**, a player can potentially score **9 or more points in a single game**.
- The **minimum score for winning a round is 1 point** (when winning with an **8-K** or via the **Control Transfer Rule**).

---

## **Next Round & Reshuffling**

- If enough cards remain to deal **5 cards to each player**, a new round begins, starting with the player to the **right of the new dealer** (the previous round's winner).
- If there are **fewer than 10 cards left** (or not enough for a full deal), **reshuffle the deck** and start a new game.
- **Scores persist across reshuffles** until a player reaches the **target score**.

---

## **Winning the Game**

- The game continues until a player reaches a **predefined target score** (e.g., **20 points**).
- The first player to reach the target **wins the overall game**.
